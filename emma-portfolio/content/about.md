I am a trans, lesbian, polyamorous, veteran, Asian woman.  I currently work as a software engineer in Chicago. It's kind of a long story how I got here (long story to be found in blog posts).

The tl;dr version.  
My egg cracked on Halloween 2019, while I was living in Tokyo with my wife thanks to a very euphoric crossplay (2B from Nier: Automata). A month later, I came out and started transitioning. After that, my marriage was headed towards a divorce, so I needed to find a way to move back to the states and support myself. I ended up going with Code Platoon, a wonderful coding bootcamp for veterans, definitely recommend. Four months later, I got a job, and here I am.

Currently spending my time living in the moment, enjoying life, and being as gay as possible.

I am a trans, lesbian, polyamorous, veteran, Asian woman.

Things that get me excited:

* Learning to do something I've never done before
* Sharing joy and good vibes with people
* Meeting as many wonderful people as I can and building connections with them
* Confronting difficult things head on
* New experiences
* ‚ö¢ GAY STUFF ‚öß

I hope that maybe something on here is relatable or interesting to you. If that's the case, [I'd love to hear from you! ‚ù§Ô∏è](/contact)
