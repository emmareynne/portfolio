<h2>Hello, this is Emma.</h2>

<p>I am a trans, lesbian, polyamorous, veteran, Asian woman.  I currently work as a software engineer in Chicago. It&rsquo;s kind of a long story how I got here (long story to be found in blog posts).</p>
<p>The tl;dr version.<br>
My egg cracked on Halloween 2019, while I was living in Tokyo with my wife thanks to a very euphoric crossplay (2B from Nier: Automata). A month later, I came out and started transitioning. After that, my marriage was headed towards a divorce, so I needed to find a way to move back to the states and support myself. I ended up going with Code Platoon, a wonderful coding bootcamp for veterans, definitely recommend. Four months later, I got a job, and here I am.</p>
<p>Currently spending my time living in the moment, enjoying life, and being as gay as possible.</p>
<p>I am a trans, lesbian, polyamorous, veteran, Asian woman.</p>
<p>Things that get me excited:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning to do something I&rsquo;ve never done before</li>
<li>Sharing joy and good vibes with people</li>
<li>Meeting as many wonderful people as I can and building connections with them</li>
<li>Confronting difficult things head on</li>
<li>New experiences</li>
<li>⚢ GAY STUFF ⚧</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that maybe something on here is relatable or interesting to you. If that&rsquo;s the case, <a href="/contact">I&rsquo;d love to hear from you! ❤️</a></p>
